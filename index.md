# Dear Monica...
This website was built with a funny technology I wanted to try since a while and a lot of **love**.

The idea is to have a present that will travel with you every day, for many many days!

_(Or until there is an unforseen update and the page breaks but I will try to fix it asap)_

# And here...

Here we can count the number of times Nathan does a Nathan
or cannot do stuff with us because he's too busy

| head1        | head two          |
|:-------------|:------------------|:
| ok           | good swedish fish |
| out of stock | good and plenty   |
| ok           | good `oreos`      |
| ok           | good `zoute` drop |

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

* * *

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
