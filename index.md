# Dear Monica...
This website was built with a funny technology I wanted to try since a while and a lot of **love**.

The idea is to have a present that will travel with you every day, for many many days!

_(Or until there is an unforseen update and the page breaks but I will try to fix it asap)_

# And here...

Here we can count the number of times Nathan does a Nathan
or cannot do stuff with us because he's too busy

> Doing a Nathan,

> Is when you invite someone over and after some drinks and a
> quarter of a join you fall asleep on the kitchen table.

| Host               | Times |

| Moni and Ypatata   |   1   |
| Nathan             |   1   |
